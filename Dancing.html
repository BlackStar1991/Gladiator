                <p>We strive for our students to experience and have a love for several styles of dance. GDA is a
                    perfect fit for students who want a quality dance education while being involved in other
                    activities. Students from ages 6-18 will love our range of classes and most of our graduating
                    students each year have been with us since they were in preschool. Many of our students and
                    familiies have told us that GDA feels more like a family than just a school. This is a wonderful
                    compliment that we take very seriously. Most importantly, we want students at every age and level to
                    love coming to class and to learn far more than just dance steps.</p>

                            as tap, ballet, pointe, modern, jazz, lyrical, hip hop, and musical theatre. Melissa
                            completed Adapt Jazz and Tap exams as well as RAD and Cecchetti Ballet exams. She attended
                            numerous workshops and dance conventions both locally and across the border including The
                            Edge Performing Arts Centre in Los Angeles and Harbour Dance Centre in Vancouver. Melissa
                            participated in the Manitoba Dance Festival and competed in numerous competitions such as
                            Centre Stage, Canadian National Dance Championships, CanDance, LADM, LADF and the Pulse. She
                            is extremely proud to have been given the opportunity to represent Canada at the World Tap
                            Championships in Germany for two consecutive years. On her second time around she was
                            fortunate to have Lori and Rob as her coaches, which was a wonderful experience for her.
                            Melissa is currently studying at the University of Manitoba in the Faculty of Arts and has
                            intentions of acquiring a Bachelor's degree in Nursing, once her Arts Degree is complete.
                            Melissa is thrilled to be part of the Kickit family and to have the opportunity to share her
                            love of dance with both students and staff at Kickit Dance studio. She is looking forward to

                            As an extremely shy 3 year old, Sara began taking dance. It took every ounce of tearful
                            courage she had to go into her class for her lessons, and even more courage to perform in
                            her recital on stage (only while holding her teachers hand). Eventually her love for dance
                            began to outweigh her fears and her dedication grew. Sara's passions in dance are for
                            Contemporary, Jazz & Hip Hop, but her training also includes Ballet, Lyrical, Tap, & Musical
                            Theatre. Sara has been a part of the competitive program at Kickit Dance Studio since 2011.
                            She has competed in Canadian National Dance Championships, Manitoba Provincial Dance
                            Festival, Shobiz Minneapolis, Triple Threat Dance Convention, Candance Regina, The Pulse on
                            Tour in Chicago & Minneapolis, Extreme Dance Convention, & 5678 Showtime. Sara was awarded
                            multiple scholarships & awards during these competitions. In 2014 Sara traveled to Los
                            Angeles California to train at Millennium Dance Complex & Edge Performing Arts Centre. She
                            had the fortunate opportunity to train with Jaja Vankova & Sho-Tyme from SYTYCD. Sara is
                            looking forward to sharing her passion of dance this year!
